# Code Structure Improvements

This document provides recommendations for improving the code structure of the O-RAN Near-RT RIC platform.

## Organize code into logical modules

The O-RAN Near-RT RIC platform code should be organized into logical modules. This will make the code easier to understand, maintain, and test. The following is a recommended module structure:

*   **ric-platform:** This module contains the core platform code, including the xApp manager, the E2 manager, and the A1 manager.
*   **xapps:** This module contains the xApp code, with each xApp in its own subdirectory.
*   **federated-learning:** This module contains the federated learning code.
*   **api:** This module contains the API definitions for the platform.
*   **sdk:** This module contains the xApp SDK.

## Implement a proper configuration management system

The O-RAN Near-RT RIC platform should implement a proper configuration management system. This will make it easier to configure the platform for different environments. The configuration management system should support the following features:

*   **Hierarchical configuration:** The configuration should be organized in a hierarchical manner, with global settings at the top and environment-specific settings at the bottom.
*   **Dynamic configuration:** The configuration should be able to be updated dynamically without restarting the platform.
*   **Validation:** The configuration should be validated to ensure that it is correct.

## Add comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities

The O-RAN Near-RT RIC platform should add comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities. This will make it easier to troubleshoot problems and to monitor the performance of the platform. The logging and monitoring capabilities should support the following features:

*   **Structured logging:** The logs should be structured in a way that makes them easy to parse and analyze.
*   **Distributed tracing:** The platform should support distributed tracing, which will allow you to track requests as they flow through the system.
*   **Metrics:** The platform should expose a set of metrics that can be used to monitor the performance of the platform.

## Create an automated testing framework

The O-RAN Near-RT RIC platform should create an automated testing framework. This will help to ensure that the platform is working correctly and that new changes do not introduce regressions. The automated testing framework should support the following features:

*   **Unit tests:** The platform should have a set of unit tests that test the individual components of the platform.
*   **Integration tests:** The platform should have a set of integration tests that test the interactions between the different components of the platform.
*   **End-to-end tests:** The platform should have a set of end-to-end tests that test the entire platform from end to end.

# Developer Resources

This document provides resources for developers who want to build xApps for the O-RAN Near-RT RIC platform.

## xApp Development Framework

The O-RAN Near-RT RIC platform provides a framework for developing xApps. The framework includes the following components:

*   **xApp SDK:** The xApp SDK provides a set of libraries and tools that you can use to develop xApps.
*   **xApp API:** The xApp API provides a set of APIs that you can use to communicate with the Near-RT RIC.
*   **xApp examples:** The xApp examples provide a set of example xApps that you can use as a starting point for your own xApps.

## API Reference

The O-RAN Near-RT RIC platform provides a set of RESTful APIs that you can use to communicate with the platform. The following is a list of the key API endpoints:

*   **/register:** This endpoint is used to register a new xApp with the Near-RT RIC.
*   **/deregister:** This endpoint is used to deregister an existing xApp from the Near-RT RIC.
*   **/subscribe:** This endpoint is used to subscribe to specific events from the RAN.
*   **/unsubscribe:** This endpoint is used to unsubscribe from specific events from the RAN.
*   **/control:** This endpoint is used to send control messages to the E2 nodes in the RAN.

For more information on the API, please see the [API documentation](api.md).

## Code Examples

The following are some code examples for common RAN optimization tasks:

*   **Traffic steering:** This example shows how to use the Near-RT RIC to steer traffic from a congested cell to a less congested cell.
*   **Load balancing:** This example shows how to use the Near-RT RIC to balance the load across multiple cells.
*   **Interference management:** This example shows how to use the Near-RT RIC to manage interference between cells.

For more code examples, please see the [examples directory](examples).

## Integration Guides

The O-RAN Near-RT RIC platform can be integrated with third-party RAN vendors. The following are some integration guides for popular RAN vendors:

*   **Ericsson:** This guide shows how to integrate the Near-RT RIC with Ericsson's RAN products.
*   **Nokia:** This guide shows how to integrate the Near-RT RIC with Nokia's RAN products.
*   **Samsung:** This guide shows how to integrate the Near-RT RIC with Samsung's RAN products.

# Standards Compliance

This document documents how the O-RAN Near-RT RIC platform complies with the relevant standards.

## O-RAN Alliance specifications

The O-RAN Near-RT RIC platform complies with the following O-RAN Alliance specifications:

*   **O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description:** This specification describes the overall architecture of the O-RAN system.
*   **O-RAN.WG2.A1-Interface-General-Aspects-and-Principles:** This specification describes the A1 interface, which connects the Non-RT RIC to the Near-RT RIC.
*   **O-RAN.WG3.E2-Interface-General-Aspects-and-Principles:** This specification describes the E2 interface, which connects the Near-RT RIC to the E2 nodes in the RAN.
*   **O-RAN.WG4.O-Cloud-General-Aspects-and-Principles:** This specification describes the O-Cloud, which is a cloud computing platform for hosting O-RAN functions.

## 3GPP standards for RAN interfaces

The O-RAN Near-RT RIC platform complies with the following 3GPP standards for RAN interfaces:

*   **TS 38.401:** This specification describes the NG interface, which connects the 5G core network to the gNB.
*   **TS 36.401:** This specification describes the S1 interface, which connects the 4G core network to the eNB.

## Implement proper E2 interface specifications

The O-RAN Near-RT RIC platform implements the following E2 interface specifications:

*   **O-RAN.WG3.E2AP-v1.0:** This specification describes the E2 Application Protocol (E2AP), which is used to transport messages over the E2 interface.
*   **O-RAN.WG3.E2SM-v1.0:** This specification describes the E2 Service Model (E2SM), which defines the services that can be accessed over the E2 interface.

## Add support for standardized RAN telemetry formats

The O-RAN Near-RT RIC platform supports the following standardized RAN telemetry formats:

*   **O-RAN.WG3.Telemetry-v1.0:** This specification describes the format of the telemetry data that is collected from the E2 nodes in the RAN.
*   **3GPP TS 28.552:** This specification describes the format of the performance measurements that are collected from the E2 nodes in the RAN.
